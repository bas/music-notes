## How to use GitHub Copilot for writing bass guitar TAB notation

- When prompted to write bass guitar TAB notation, ensure that you use the standard tuning of E A D G.
- Use proper TAB formatting to ensure that the notation is clear and easy to read.
- **ALWAYS use ````tab` language specifier for TAB examples in markdown code blocks** - this is required for semantic markdown and automated testing.
- When writing a standard scale always use just the octave pattern (8 notes in total)
- when tasked to write a pentatonic scale include the 5 notes and the octave (6 notes in total)
- When writing a mode, use the same approach as with standard scales (8 notes in total)
- When writing a chord, include the root note, the third, the fifth, and any other relevant notes (typically 4 notes in total)
- Always start with the root note.
- When you are tasked to write an example, like a bassline in the style of James Jamerson or a typical blues scale, then you are allowed to use more than 8 notes.

Here is a correct example for C-major:

**Notes:** C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C

```tab
G|--------------2-4-5--|
D|--------2-3-5--------|
A|--3-5----------------|
E|---------------------|
```

Here is another correct example for E major:

**Notes:** E, F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E

```tab
G|-------------------------|
D|----------------11-13-14-|
A|-------11-12-14----------|
E|-12-14-------------------|
```

Here is an incorrect example of the E major scale with too many notes:

```tab
G|----------------11-13-14-|
D|-------11-13-14----------|
A|-11-12-14----------------|
E|-12-14-------------------|
```

In general, avoid using open strings in your examples. For instance, when asked to write a F# dorian scale, do this:

**Notes:** F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#

```tab
G|------------------|
D|------------1-2-4-|
A|--------2-4-------|
E|--2-4-5-----------|
```

Rather than this:

**Notes:** F#, G#, A, B, C#, D#, E, F#

```tab
G|------------------|
D|------------1-2-4-|
A|------0-2-4-------|
E|--2-4-------------|
```
