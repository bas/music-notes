# Music Theory for Bass Guitar: Understanding Modes (The Right Way)

The best way to understand modes is to start them all on the **same root note**. This is called the **"parallel modes"** approach. It allows you to clearly hear the unique character and color of each mode because the only thing changing is the scale formula itself, not the root note.

## The 7 Modes in Parallel (All Starting on C)

We will use **C** as our root note for all examples.

### 1. C Ionian (The Major Scale)
*   **Notes:** C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C
*   **Formula:** W-W-H-W-W-W-H
*   **Sound:** The standard happy, bright sound of the major scale.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|--------------2-4-5--|
    D|--------2-3-5--------|
    A|--3-5----------------|
    E|---------------------|
    ```

### 2. C Dorian
*   **Notes:** C, D, Eb, F, G, A, Bb, C
*   **Formula:** W-H-W-W-W-H-W
*   **Sound:** A minor mode (because of the flat 3rd, Eb) but with a "bright" or "jazzy" feel from the major 6th (A). Very popular in funk and jazz.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------2-3-5--|
    D|----------3-5--------|
    A|----3-5-6------------|
    E|---------------------|
    ```

### 3. C Phrygian
*   **Notes:** C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C
*   **Formula:** H-W-W-W-H-W-W
*   **Sound:** A dark, tense minor mode. The flat 2nd (Db) right after the root gives it a distinctive Spanish or Flamenco sound.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------3-5----|
    D|---------3-5-6------|
    A|---3-4-6------------|
    E|--------------------|
    ```

### 4. C Lydian
*   **Notes:** C, D, E, F#, G, A, B, C
*   **Formula:** W-W-W-H-W-W-H
*   **Sound:** A major mode that sounds even brighter or more "magical" than Ionian because of the sharp 4th (F#).
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------2-4-5--|
    D|---------2-4-5-------|
    A|---3-5---------------|
    E|---------------------|
    ```

### 5. C Mixolydian
*   **Notes:** C, D, E, F, G, A, Bb, C
*   **Formula:** W-W-H-W-W-H-W
*   **Sound:** A major mode with a "bluesy" or "rock" edge because of the flat 7th (Bb). This is the sound of dominant 7th chords.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------2-3-5--|
    D|---------2-3-5-------|
    A|---3-5---------------|
    E|---------------------|
    ```

### 6. C Aeolian (The Natural Minor Scale)
*   **Notes:** C, D, Eb, F, G, Ab, Bb, C
*   **Formula:** W-H-W-W-H-W-W
*   **Sound:** The standard sad or melancholic sound of the natural minor scale.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------1-3-5--|
    D|----------3-5--------|
    A|----3-4-6------------|
    E|---------------------|
    ```

### 7. C Locrian
*   **Notes:** C, Db, Eb, F, Gb, Ab, Bb, C
*   **Formula:** H-W-W-H-W-W-W
*   **Sound:** The darkest and most dissonant mode. Its flat 5th (Gb) makes it sound unstable, and it's the least used mode for melodies.
*   **TAB:**
    ```
    G|-------------3-5----|
    D|---------3-4-6------|
    A|---3-4-6------------|
    E|--------------------|
    ```

## Summary Table: Parallel Modes

This table compares the intervals of each mode when they all start on C. This makes it easy to see the one or two notes that give each mode its unique flavor.

| Mode Name     | 1 | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  | 6  | 7  | Character vs. Major/Minor |
| :------------ | :-| :--| :--| :--| :--| :--| :--| :------------------------ |
| **C Ionian**  | C | D  | E  | F  | G  | A  | B  | The Major Scale           |
| **C Dorian**  | C | D  | Eb | F  | G  | A  | Bb | Minor with a **major 6th**    |
| **C Phrygian**| C | Db | Eb | F  | G  | Ab | Bb | Minor with a **flat 2nd**     |
| **C Lydian**  | C | D  | E  | F# | G  | A  | B  | Major with a **sharp 4th**    |
| **C Mixolydian**| C | D  | E  | F  | G  | A  | Bb | Major with a **flat 7th**     |
| **C Aeolian** | C | D  | Eb | F  | G  | Ab | Bb | The Natural Minor Scale   |
| **C Locrian** | C | Db | Eb | F  | Gb | Ab | Bb | Minor with a **flat 2nd & flat 5th** |

## The pattern

The pattern among parallel modes is a gradual shift from **brightest to darkest**, where each step involves changing only **one note** by a half-step (adding one flat or removing one sharp).

### The "Brightest to Darkest" Spectrum

Think of the modes as a spectrum of sound. The order from brightest to darkest is:

**Lydian -> Ionian -> Mixolydian -> Dorian -> Aeolian -> Phrygian -> Locrian**

Let's see how this works starting from C Lydian, the brightest mode.

1.  **C Lydian** (Brightest: Major scale with a #4)
    *   Notes: `C D E F# G A B`

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the F# to F.*

2.  **C Ionian** (The Major Scale)
    *   Notes: `C D E F G A B` (The F# became F)

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the B to Bb.*

3.  **C Mixolydian** (Major scale with a b7)
    *   Notes: `C D E F G A Bb` (The B became Bb)

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the E to Eb.*

4.  **C Dorian** (Minor scale with a major 6)
    *   Notes: `C D Eb F G A Bb` (The E became Eb)

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the A to Ab.*

5.  **C Aeolian** (The Natural Minor Scale)
    *   Notes: `C D Eb F G Ab Bb` (The A became Ab)

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the D to Db.*

6.  **C Phrygian** (Minor scale with a b2)
    *   Notes: `C Db Eb F G Ab Bb` (The D became Db)

    *To get to the next mode, we flatten the G to Gb.*

7.  **C Locrian** (Darkest: Minor scale with a b2 and b5)
    *   Notes: `C Db Eb F Gb Ab Bb` (The G became Gb)

### The Pattern of Flattening

The pattern is that you sequentially flatten the notes in this order: **4th, 7th, 3rd, 6th, 2nd, 5th**.

| Mode       | Change from Previous Mode | Resulting Scale (Starting from C) |
| :--------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------- |
| **Lydian** | (Brightest Starting Point)  | C D E **F#** G A B                |
| **Ionian** | Flatten the 4th           | C D E **F** G A B                 |
| **Mixolydian**| Flatten the 7th           | C D E F G A **Bb**                |
| **Dorian** | Flatten the 3rd           | C D **Eb** F G A Bb               |
| **Aeolian**| Flatten the 6th           | C D Eb F G **Ab** Bb              |
| **Phrygian**| Flatten the 2nd           | C **Db** Eb F G Ab Bb             |
| **Locrian**| Flatten the 5th           | C Db Eb F **Gb** Ab Bb            |

This sequence is directly related to the **Circle of Fifths**, which is why it feels so musically logical.

This is an incredibly useful way to think about modes because if you know one mode shape on the fretboard, you can find any other parallel mode just by moving one note up or down a single fret.

## The 7 Parallel Modes of E

Here are the same 7 modes, but all starting on the root note **E**. This demonstrates how the formulas apply to any key.

*   **Notes:** E, F#, G, A, B, C#, D, E
*   **Formula:** W-H-W-W-W-H-W
