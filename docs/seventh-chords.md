# Seventh Chords: Adding Color and Complexity

Seventh chords are the heart of jazz, soul, and R&B harmony. By adding one more note—the seventh—to a basic triad, you create a richer, more complex sound that opens up a world of new melodic and harmonic possibilities.

This guide will introduce you to the three most important seventh chords and show you how to use them to create sophisticated, soulful bass lines.

## The Three Essential Seventh Chords

### 1. Minor Seventh (m7)
The **minor seventh chord** combines a minor triad with a minor seventh interval. This creates a smooth, mellow sound that's perfect for soul and jazz.

*   **Formula:** Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th
*   **Example (Cm7):** C - E♭ - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a Cm7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E♭, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---1-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## What is a Seventh Chord?

A seventh chord is a four-note chord built by adding a seventh (the seventh note of the scale) to a triad (root-third-fifth). This additional note creates a richer, more nuanced sound than a simple triad.

There are several types of seventh chords, but the three you'll encounter most often are:

1.  **Major Seventh (maj7)**
2.  **Minor Seventh (m7)**
3.  **Dominant Seventh (7)**

## Major Seventh Chords (maj7)

A Major Seventh chord is built on a major triad, with the major seventh added. It has a dreamy, sweet, and thoughtful sound.

*   **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - 7
*   **Example (Cmaj7):** C - E - G - B

Here is how you would play a Cmaj7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E, G, B.

G|-----4---|
D|---2-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## Minor Seventh Chords (m7)

A Minor Seventh chord is built on a minor triad, with a flattened seventh (b7) added. It has a melancholic, smooth, and soulful sound. It is one of the most common chords in soul, R&B, and jazz.

*   **Formula:** 1 - b3 - 5 - b7
*   **Example (Cm7):** C - E♭ - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a Cm7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E♭, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---1-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

---

## Dominant Seventh Chords (7)

The Dominant Seventh chord is built on a major triad, but with a flattened seventh (b7). This combination of a happy-sounding major triad and a tense b7 creates a powerful pull that wants to resolve to the root. It's the sound of blues, funk, and the "V" chord in a jazz progression.

*   **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - b7
*   **Example (C7):** C - E - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a C7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---2-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

### Visualizing The Dominant 7th Arpeggio Shape

The Dominant 7th arpeggio is one of the most important shapes to know, as it's the foundation of blues and funk bass lines. Its unique combination of a major 3rd and a flat 7th creates a sound full of tension and release.

#### The Dominant 7th Shape

Here is a common, movable shape for a Dominant 7th arpeggio. We'll use **G7** as our example, with the root on the 3rd fret of the E string.

| String | Fret 2 | Fret 3 | Fret 4 | Fret 5 |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **G**  |        |   `3`  |        |   `5`  |
| **D**  |        |        |   `4`  |        |
| **A**  |        |        |        |        |
| **E**  |        |   `3`  |        |        |

**Note Breakdown (G7):**
*   **G** (Root): E string, 3rd fret
*   **B** (3rd): D string, 4th fret
*   **D** (5th): G string, 5th fret
*   **F** (b7): G string, 3rd fret

#### The Same Shape, New Key: C7

To play a **C7** arpeggio, we simply move that same shape up to the 8th fret of the E string, where our root note is C.

| String | Fret 7 | Fret 8 | Fret 9 | Fret 10 |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **G**  |        |   `8`  |        |   `10` |
| **D**  |        |        |   `9`  |        |
| **A**  |        |        |        |        |
| **E**  |        |   `8`  |        |        |

This movable shape is a fundamental building block for creating walking bass lines, blues riffs, and funky grooves.

## Putting It All Together: The II-V-I Progression

The **II-V-I** (two-five-one) progression is the most important chord sequence in jazz and soul. It uses the chords built on the 2nd, 5th, and 1st degrees of the scale. In the key of C Major, this gives us:

*   **II:** Dm7
*   **V:** G7
*   **I:** Cmaj7

Here is a simple bass line that outlines this progression using the arpeggios we've learned. Notice how the G7 chord creates tension that is beautifully resolved when we land on the Cmaj7.

```
  Dm7 (D-F-A-C)       G7 (G-B-D-F)        Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B)
  1  2  3  4          1  2  3  4          1
G|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
D|-7--5--------------|-------------------|---5--4----------|
A|-------8--7--------|-5--3--------------|---------7--5----|
E|-------------------|-------6--5--------|-3---------------|
```

By mastering the sound and feel of these three seventh chords, you'll be able to navigate the harmony of countless jazz, soul, and R&B classics and start creating your own sophisticated bass lines.
