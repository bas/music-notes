# Seventh Chords: Adding Color and Complexity

Seventh chords are the heart of jazz, soul, and R&B harmony. By adding one more note—the seventh—to a basic triad, you create a richer, more complex sound that opens up a world of new melodic and harmonic possibilities.

This guide will introduce you to the three most important seventh chords and show you how to use them to create sophisticated, soulful bass lines.

## The Three Essential Seventh Chords

### 1. Minor Seventh (m7)
The **minor seventh chord** combines a minor triad with a minor seventh interval. This creates a smooth, mellow sound that's perfect for soul and jazz.

*   **Formula:** Root + Minor 3rd + Perfect 5th + Minor 7th
*   **Example (Cm7):** C - E♭ - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a Cm7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E♭, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---1-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## What is a Seventh Chord?

A seventh chord is a four-note chord built by adding a seventh (the seventh note of the scale) to a triad (root-third-fifth). This additional note creates a richer, more nuanced sound than a simple triad.

There are several types of seventh chords, but the three you'll encounter most often are:

1.  **Major Seventh (maj7)**
2.  **Minor Seventh (m7)**
3.  **Dominant Seventh (7)**

## Major Seventh Chords (maj7)

A Major Seventh chord is built on a major triad, with the major seventh added. It has a dreamy, sweet, and thoughtful sound.

*   **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - 7
*   **Example (Cmaj7):** C - E - G - B

Here is how you would play a Cmaj7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E, G, B.

G|-----4---|
D|---2-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## Minor Seventh Chords (m7)

A Minor Seventh chord is built on a minor triad, with a flattened seventh (b7) added. It has a melancholic, smooth, and soulful sound. It is one of the most common chords in soul, R&B, and jazz.

*   **Formula:** 1 - b3 - 5 - b7
*   **Example (Cm7):** C - E♭ - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a Cm7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E♭, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---1-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## Dominant Seventh Chords (7)

The Dominant Seventh chord is built on a major triad, but with a flattened seventh (b7). This combination of a happy-sounding major triad and a tense b7 creates a powerful pull that wants to resolve to the root. It's the sound of blues, funk, and the "V" chord in a jazz progression.

*   **Formula:** 1 - 3 - 5 - b7
*   **Example (C7):** C - E - G - B♭

Here is how you would play a C7 arpeggio on the bass:

```
The notes are C, E, G, B♭.

G|-----3---|
D|---2-5---|
A|-3-------|
E|---------|
```

## Putting It All Together: The II-V-I Progression

The **II-V-I** (two-five-one) progression is the most important chord sequence in jazz and soul. It uses the chords built on the 2nd, 5th, and 1st degrees of the scale. In the key of C Major, this gives us:

*   **II:** Dm7
*   **V:** G7
*   **I:** Cmaj7

Here is a simple bass line that outlines this progression using the arpeggios we've learned. Notice how the G7 chord creates tension that is beautifully resolved when we land on the Cmaj7.

```
  Dm7 (D-F-A-C)       G7 (G-B-D-F)        Cmaj7 (C-E-G-B)
  1  2  3  4          1  2  3  4          1
G|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
D|-7--5--------------|-------------------|---5--4----------|
A|-------8--7--------|-5--3--------------|---------7--5----|
E|-------------------|-------6--5--------|-3---------------|
```

By mastering the sound and feel of these three seventh chords, you'll be able to navigate the harmony of countless jazz, soul, and R&B classics and start creating your own sophisticated bass lines.
