# Walking Bass Lines

This article provides 2-bar walking bass line examples for "So What" by Miles Davis. The song is typically played at 136 BPM or even faster. "So What" uses a 32-bar AABA pattern where the A sections are in D Dorian and the B section is in Eb Dorian. "So What" is a classic example of modal jazz, where the improvisation is based on modes rather than chord changes.

## Appendix: Understanding Modal Jazz

A **mode** in jazz refers to a type of scale that serves as the harmonic foundation for improvisation and composition. Unlike traditional jazz which relies on frequent chord changes, modal jazz uses modes (which are variations of the major scale starting from different degrees) as the primary basis for creating melodies and harmonies.

In "So What":
- The **D Dorian mode** contains the notes D-E-F-G-A-B-C (essentially a D minor scale with a raised 6th degree - B natural instead of Bb)
- The **Eb Dorian mode** contains the notes Eb-F-Gb-Ab-Bb-C-Db (the same pattern but starting from Eb)

What makes this "modal" is that instead of playing over complex chord progressions with many changes, the musicians improvise using the notes of these modes for extended periods. This creates a different harmonic color and allows for more exploration of the mode's characteristic sound rather than navigating through chord changes.

The bass lines in this document stay strictly within these modes, which is typical of modal jazz - the walking bass emphasizes the mode's notes to support and reinforce the modal harmony rather than outlining traditional chord progressions.
