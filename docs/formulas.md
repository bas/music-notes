# Music Theory for Bass Guitar: Scale Formulas

This guide explains the fundamental building blocks of scales on the bass guitar: **Whole Steps** and **Half Steps**.

### Half Step (H)

A **Half Step** is the smallest interval in Western music. On the bass guitar, it's the distance from one fret to the very next fret on the same string.

*   **Example:** Playing the 2nd fret on the E string (F#) and then the 3rd fret on the E string (G) is a half step.

### Whole Step (W)

A **Whole Step** is equal to two half steps. On the bass, this means moving up two frets on the same string.

*   **Example:** Playing the 2nd fret on the E string (F#) and then the 4th fret on the E string (G#) is a whole step.

## Scale Formulas

Scales are built from unique patterns of whole and half steps. This pattern defines the scale's character.

### The Major Scale Formula

The formula for any Major Scale is:
**W - W - H - W - W - W - H**

This pattern creates the happy, bright sound of a major scale.

**Example: G Major Scale**
The notes are G, A, B, C, D, E, F#.

Let's apply the formula starting from G:
*   **G** to **A** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **A** to **B** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **B** to **C** -> Half Step (1 fret)
*   **C** to **D** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **D** to **E** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **E** to **F#** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **F#** to **G** -> Half Step (1 fret)

Here is one way to play it on the bass:
```
G|--------------2-4--|
D|--------2-4-5------|
A|--2-3-5------------|
E|-------------------|
```

### The Natural Minor Scale Formula

The formula for any Natural Minor Scale is:
**W - H - W - W - H - W - W**

This pattern creates the sad or pensive sound of a minor scale.

**Example: E Natural Minor Scale**
The notes are E, F#, G, A, B, C, D.

Let's apply the formula starting from E:
*   **E** to **F#** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **F#** to **G** -> Half Step (1 fret)
*   **G** to **A** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **A** to **B** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **B** to **C** -> Half Step (1 fret)
*   **C** to **D** -> Whole Step (2 frets)
*   **D** to **E** -> Whole Step (2 frets)

Here is one way to play it on the bass, starting on the 7th fret of the A string:
```
G|------------7-9----|
D|------7-9-10-------|
A|--7-9-10-----------|
E|-------------------|
```
