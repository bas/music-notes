# Music Theory for Bass Guitar: The Pentatonic Scales

The **Pentatonic Scale** is one of the most important and widely used scales in modern music, especially for bass players. The name "penta" means five, and as the name suggests, it's a five-note scale.

Because it has fewer notes than the standard seven-note major or minor scales, it's easier to play and almost always sounds good, with no "avoid" notes.

## The Major Pentatonic Scale

The Major Pentatonic scale is a stripped-down version of the Major Scale. It has a happy, open, and universally pleasing sound. It's the sound of folk, country, and much of classic rock.

### Formula and Construction

To create a Major Pentatonic scale, you simply take the standard Major Scale and remove the 4th and 7th degrees.

*   **Major Scale:** 1 - 2 - 3 - **4** - 5 - 6 - **7**
*   **Major Pentatonic:** 1 - 2 - 3 - 5 - 6

**Example: C Major vs. C Major Pentatonic**

*   **C Major Scale:** C, D, E, F, G, A, B
*   **C Major Pentatonic:** C, D, E, G, A (we removed the F and B)

The notes are C, D, E, G, A, C.

Here is one way to play it on the bass:
```
G|-----------2-5--|
D|-------2-5------|
A|-3-5------------|
E|----------------|
```

## The Minor Pentatonic Scale

The Minor Pentatonic scale is derived from the Natural Minor Scale. It's the sound of blues, rock, and funk. If you learn only one scale for soloing or writing riffs, this is the one.

### Formula and Construction

To create a Minor Pentatonic scale, you take the Natural Minor Scale and remove the 2nd and 6th degrees.

*   **Natural Minor Scale:** 1 - **2** - b3 - 4 - 5 - **b6** - b7
*   **Minor Pentatonic:** 1 - b3 - 4 - 5 - b7

**Example: A Minor vs. A Minor Pentatonic**

*   **A Natural Minor:** A, B, C, D, E, F, G
*   **A Minor Pentatonic:** A, C, D, E, G (we removed the B and F)

The notes are A, C, D, E, G, A.

Here is one way to play it on the bass (the classic "box" shape):
```
G|-----------5-7--|
D|-------5-7------|
A|-5-8------------|
E|----------------|
```

## The Relationship Between Major and Minor Pentatonic

Just like the full major and minor scales, the Major and Minor Pentatonic scales have a relative relationship.

**A Minor Pentatonic has the exact same notes as C Major Pentatonic.**

*   **C Major Pentatonic:** C, D, E, G, A
*   **A Minor Pentatonic:** A, C, D, E, G

This means that any pentatonic pattern you learn on the fretboard can be used for either a major or minor scale, depending on which note you treat as the root.

*   If you play the C Major Pentatonic pattern but emphasize the **A** notes, you are playing in **A Minor Pentatonic**.
*   If you play the A Minor Pentatonic pattern but emphasize the **C** notes, you are playing in **C Major Pentatonic**.

This is a fundamental concept that allows you to get a huge amount of mileage out of just a few scale shapes.
